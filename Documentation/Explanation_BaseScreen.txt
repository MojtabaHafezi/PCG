For passing the objects upon system events i need an Eventsystem object which returns the EventSystem of Unity (finding it through its name). 
Whenever i call OnFocus i will pass the selected Gameobject through the firstSelected GameObject. 

This will be the base class for other screens. The awake method needs to be overwritten by the child classes to not automatically close the windows.

When the Open method gets called, this gameobject gets displayed and the focus is set on. The firstSelected gameobject is for example new game on the startscreen etc.
